# uMap: Visualizing spatial historical data


### Lesson in a nutshell:

1. Embedding historical maps as custom overlay in uMap
2. Enriching a dataset wich spatial information (coordinates and polygons) in GeoJson.io
3. Which kind of layers or visualizations do I need?
4. Uploading spatial data into and Creating layers in uMap
5. Editing layers (shape, color, pop-ups, user interface, etc.) in uMap
6. Adding text and images to popups
7. Setting up a slide show
8. Saving maps as images
9. Saving spatial data for future use in other GIS tools

   


## Step 1.: INTEGRATION OF THE HISTORICAL MAP WITH A MODERN ONE

a. Log in to uMap
b. Click on "Create a Map" (top right)
c. Name the map (top left)
d. Zoom to the desired geographic area
e. Click on "Settings" - "Custom Overlay"
f. Enter the (MapWarper) link of the historical map
g. Verify if the georeferencing aligns with the visualization goals.
