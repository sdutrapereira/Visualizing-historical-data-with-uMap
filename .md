# uMap: Visualizing spatial historical data


#### Lesson in a nutshell:

1. Embedding historical maps as custom overlay in uMap
2. Enriching a dataset wich spatial information (coordinates and polygons) in GeoJson.io
3. Which kind of layers or visualizations do I need?
4. Uploading spatial data into and Creating layers in uMap
5. Editing layers (shape, color, pop-ups, user interface, etc.) in uMap
6. Adding text and images to popups
7. Setting up a slide show
8. Saving maps as images
9. Saving spatial data for future use in other GIS tools

   

### Step 1: Embedding historical maps as custom overlay in uMap

* Log in to uMap
* Click on "Create a Map" (top right)
* Name the map (top left)
* Zoom to the desired geographic area
* Click on "Settings" - "Custom Overlay"
* Enter the (MapWarper) link of the historical map
* Verify if the georeferenced map aligns with the visualization goals.

### Step 2: Enriching a dataset wich spatial information (coordinates and polygons) in GeoJson.io

* We work on http://geojson.io (No registration required)
* Create a table with numbered IDs for the needed locations
* Zoom to the desired geographic area
* If necessary, integrate a historical map (Tab "Meta – Add tile raster layer")
* Define points, lines, or polygons in order (Numbered ID: crucial!!!)
* Save the coordinate file (Tab "Save" – CSV or GeoJson)
* (depending on geometry: points: .csv, lines or polygons: .geojson)
* Upload the GeoJson files directly to uMap (as layers)
